# claudio.dev

This is my personal portfolio site — a place to document my dev learning journey.

I started as a **3D artist**, spent years creating assets and visuals, and now I’m diving deep into **front-end development**.  
The goal for this site was simple: **keep it clean, make it mine and have fun with it**.

## What’s inside
- Fully responsive design (desktop → mobile)
- Accessible navigation (yes, there’s a “Skip to content” link)
- Animated hero text just for fun
- CSS variables for colors, spacing, and type scale
- Plain HTML + CSS — no frameworks, no shortcuts

## Tech I used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, custom properties)
- Fonts from [Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com/)

## Why I built it
I wanted something I could look back on and say: *that’s where I started*.  
Something to keep me motivated to commit every day.  
It’s also a base I can keep improving as I learn more about JS, animation, and accessibility.
