\
This is my personal portfolio site \'97 a place to document my dev learning journey.\
\
I started as a **3D artist**, spent years creating assets and visuals, and now I\'92m diving deep into **front-end development**.  \
The goal for this site was simple: **keep it clean, make it mine and have fun with it**.\
\
## What\'92s inside\
- Fully responsive design (desktop \uc0\u8594  mobile)\
- Accessible navigation (yes, there\'92s a \'93Skip to content\'94 link)\
- Animated hero text just for fun\
- CSS variables for colors, spacing, and type scale\
- Plain HTML + CSS \'97 no frameworks, no shortcuts\
\
## Tech I used\
- HTML5\
- CSS3 (Flexbox, custom properties)\
- Fonts from [Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com/)\
\
## Why I built it\
I wanted something I could look back on and say: *that\'92s where I started*.  \
Something to keep me motivated to commit every day.  \
It\'92s also a base I can keep improving as I learn more about JS, animation, and accessibility.\
